# Reading Notes 2

1) Which is better in a CPU, more cores or higher speed? Under which circumstances is that true? How many CPU cores does a computer need?
   - Generally speaking, the speed is more important, and the number of cores will tend to increase as higher speed is provided; however, price goes up with speed and cores so the circumstances are determined by the intended use case of the assembled computer. I don't see it in the reading, but I think a modern computer needs at least 4 cores to function for basic home office purposes.

2) What details are you looking for when finding a motherboard which fits your processor?
   - Most important is ensuring that the board has the right socket type/size to accept the processor. Second is checking for external ports, PCI/PCIe availability, RAM slots and type to support the processing speed of the CPU, etc.

3) What are the tradeoffs you’d evaluate while selecting a storage device?
   - The most important considerations are port availability on the motherboard and price, followed closely by intended use case and required data storage size.

4) Think about others with a background similar to yours. How would you explain to them the key parts of a computer, in a way they’d best connect with?
   - I tried telling my young son about a computer and used the metaphor of a human body and organs: CPU/Brain, Motherboard/nervous system, RAM/short term memory, Storage/long term memory, fans/skin(think sweat - cooling system).
