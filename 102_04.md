# Reading 4

## Here are my notes for Reading 4

- What is Ubuntu?
     - An open-source Linux operating system.
 
- Why would you choose to install the LTS version over regular Ubuntu releases?
     - LTS = Long-term support, which means Canonical will provide support for the OS for five years, as opposed to the standard releases every six months which are only supported for nine months post-release.

- What is the Ubuntu GNOME Shell?
     - It's the default desktop environment - the actual graphical display. 

- How do I install software from the command line?
     - You use either apt-get or sudo apt install.
