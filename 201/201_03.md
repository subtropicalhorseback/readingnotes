## What are the Help Desk Roles :( ?

### What role does the help desk professional play within an organization, particularly in relation to customers?
   - The help desk is the first line of support for most internal customers. The organization relies on the help desk to resolve technical problems for other functional staff (the customers).

### The article differentiates between hard and soft skills. In your culture or community, are there specific skills that are highly valued? How do they compare to the skills mentioned in the article?
   - I think that soft skills are all pretty universally valued, at least at the nation-scale. The hard skills in a help desk context (actual IT troubleshooting) are not perfectly aligned with the hard skills that used to be important in my career (like foreign language analysis), but in combination with the soft skills it mostly balances out. I don't think "business skills" are a hard skill; I don't think the description of business skills in the reading = business skills in practice; the description is more like the ability to use an application.
     
### Why have security skills become more important in recent years for help desk technicians?
   - Threat and risk are always changing, especially in a technical context.

### How do writing skills and critical thinking skills play a vital role in the work of help desk technicians?
   - If you can't think, you can't evaluate what is causing a given problem. If you can't write, you can't tell other people how to prevent/resolve the problem.
