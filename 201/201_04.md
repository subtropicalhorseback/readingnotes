## A+ Troubleshooting Techniques

### What should you do if multiple issues are happening simultaneously during troubleshooting?
   - Approach each problem individually (Occam's razor)

### What should be done once a successful solution has been identified during the troubleshooting process?
   - Establish a plan of action then implement, evaluate,  and document. 
     
### What are the benefits of documenting the entire troubleshooting process in a knowledge base?
   - So that 1) you and your team know what was done to fix the problem and 2) if other users have similar problems in the future, the fix can be replicated.

### Think about a technological device particularly popular in your culture or community. Imagine a scenario where issues arise: how would you apply CompTIA A+ troubleshooting methodology to help, while considering the end-userâ€™s cultural background?
   - I don't know that I have a distinct culture or community, but as an example, a smart phone or laptop could experience a problem, and the steps described in this video/reading could applied to evaluation and remediation of that problem. Generally, I don't think end-users' backgrounds have any relevance to how a device works or how a problem can be resolved; the relevance is in how the device is used.
