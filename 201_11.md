## Data Restoration, Startup Repair, and Secure Disposal


### What are some common indicators that an SSD may be failing?
   - According to the article, "Saving, reading, and moving files may result in failure; active applications may operate slowly or frequently crash; the user may receive prompts to repair the file system; and general performance may steadily decrease, especially when handling large files."

### How do SSD failures differ from HDD failures in terms of detectability?
   - SSD failure is more evident through software interaction; HDD failure can be audible/physical and therefore detectable earlier.

### What are bad blocks in an SSD, and how do they affect its performance?
   - They are storage segments that either have memory corruption or physical damage, impeding data storage and retrieval.

### How can power cycling an SSD help resolve certain issues?
   - Removing the power supply to an SSD can basically reset it, which may or may not help resolve the problem.

### How might this topic be relevant in the aftermath of a natural disaster? Describe how individuals or communities can use these techniques to recover data and resume their normal activities.
   - I thought about hospitals in New Orleans, LA in the wake of Hurricane Katrina (2005). The ability for emergency services to get back up and running was critical to saving lives - and it's not like they had alternate local sites to operate from.
