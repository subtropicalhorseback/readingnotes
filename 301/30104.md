 Routing in VMs and VirtualBox

> Which network mode in Vbox emulates an unplugged ethernet cable?
   - Not attached or unchecking the Cable connected box.

> Which network mode would be best if you wanted a VM server to be fully accessible on the physical LAN?
   - Bridged mode.

> What are the three options of promiscuous mode and what does each do?
   - Normal mode - filtered by MAC for the adapter and destination in the header
   - promiscuous mode - physical adapter has multiple MACs; available in bridged, NAT network, and internal network:
      1. Deny - any traffic not addressed to the VM is hidden (default)
      2. Allow VMs - all traffic is hidden from the VM adapter except to/from other VMs
      3. Allow all - no restrictions; the VM network adapter can see all traffic

> What is port forwarding?
   - The process of a router intercepting traffic on a specific port and forwarding that traffic to a specific IP address (or another port) based on header information.
