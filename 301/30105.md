> What is a site-to-site VPN?
   - It is a connection to virtually connect multiple disparate networks such as different office buildings into one combined private network with encrypted "internal" traffic.

> What is TCP/IP and what is it used for?
   - TCP/IP lays out data organization, transmission, and receipt.

> What are some popular reasons for using a VPN?
   - For personal users, mask your IP address from websites or remote servers, access geo-blocked content, and improve general security through traffic encryption.

> Explain the difference between the three types of VPNs.
   - Remote Access VPNs are temporary and used to enable remote work or access to remote servers, allow employees to connect directly from different locations, and -in reverse- to enable corporate monitoring of remote employee devices and remote corporate service desk support.

   - Intranet site-to-site VPNs connect multiple LANs to create a private, sometimes Software-Defined, WAN. Similar to a remote access VPN, this enables real-time, remote access to shared resources.

   - Extranet site-to-site VPNs are topologically similar to Intranet VPNs, but they are used to connect multiple nodes that want to maintain some internal traffic privately from the other nodes, sharing only specified services or data.
