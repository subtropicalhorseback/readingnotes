> What is a server, and how is it different from a regular computer? How would you describe this difference to a friend who doesnâ€™t know much about computers?
   - A server is the freight train to your sedan: it carries a heavier load, works harder, and is in the background. The interface isn't simple, and you haven't done it before. Without the train, systems and services fail; without the sedan, your day is less convenient.

> How does the way Windows Server receives updates differ from Windows Home and Pro?
   - Updates on Server are controlled by group policy, since theoretically a user isn't logged in all the time and the services/files on the server might be needed active 24/7 such as with webservers.

> Does Windows Server have different hardware requirements than Windows Home or Pro?
   - Windows Server allows much, much higher hardware specs than Home/Pro.
