> What is CIDR notation? a CIDR block?
   - CIDR notation represents a CIDR block, which is a range of IP addresses.

> How many octets are found in an IPv4 address?
   - There are 4 octets of 8 bits each.

> Setting binary aside and using the decimal system, what is the range of numbers found in an octet?
   - 256

> What does the final digit after the / represent in an IPv4 address?
   - The number represents the number of bits that make up the mask.

> How many IP addresses are in the CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24?
   - 256, because 24 bits are used for the mask, so only 8 bits are available for the IP addresses.

> In your own words, describe network segmentation.
   - Segmentation is to networks what partitions are to hard drives.

> Network segmentation isn't important as long as the network is using a well configured firewall. Do you agree? Why or why not?
   - As with everything else, it depends. I think most scenarios for small networks, like a SOHO case, don't need segmentation because the firewall creates sufficient barriers that the 'juice isn't worth the squeeze'.

> What is a screened subnet?
   - An internal network with an additional layer of security, normally in the form of a router with a firewall, which acts as an outer barrier before the device firewalls encounter threats.

> Cameras, ID card scanners, locked doors, and biometrics are just a few examples of what type of security?
   - Physical security.
