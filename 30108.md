 AAA [resource](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-network-aaa-authentication-authorization-and-accounting/)

> Explain each of the three Aâ€™s as you would to a non-technical family member. Use an analogy or a story.
   - Authentication, Authorization, Accounting - I am Ian, a member of the family. Members of the family are authorized to eat cookies from the cookie jar. I send a text to the family group chat 'I am eating a cookie from the family cookie jar'. 

> What should the administrator do if the ACS server fails to authenticate a user during AAA implementation?
   - Use the local database as a backup.

> What is the role of the NAS in the AAA implementation using an ACS server? Use a diagram.
   - It sends authentication requests to ACS or local database.

> What are the benefits of using RADIUS for authentication and authorization?
   - Security, scalability, and AAA

> What is RADIUS and what does it stand for?
   - Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service; it's a "software that enables remote access servers to communicate with a central server to authenticate dial-in users and authorize their access to the requested system or service."

> Research: What encryption algorithms does RADIUS use?
   - There's no specific requirement; PSK, MD5, SHA have all been used as well as probably more.
