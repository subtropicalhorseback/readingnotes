 Traffic Mirroring

[resource](https://accedian.com/blog/capture-network-traffic-span-vs-tap/)

> What are the differences between SPAN and TAP?
   - SPAN is Port Mirroring (aka roving analysis) and copies packet traffic from a port range or VLAN of a switch to an additional port that is designated for the analysis tool.
   - TAP is a hardware device that passively captures network traffic, typically at a point on a hardline connection between two nodes.

> What types of network devices can support network traffic mirroring?
   - Switches, ethernet repeaters, and TAPs

> How can network traffic mirroring be used for network security?
   - It can be useful in Accounting/Nonrepudiation and to monitor latency/resource draw (is reality consistent with expectations or is there an otherwise undetected problem).

> Are there any legal or ethical considerations when using network traffic monitoring?
   - Not if you own the network. Certainly there's an effect on privacy/civil liberties in a corporate context, even if the employees sign an AUP and consent to monitoring, but that's not a "legal" issue.
