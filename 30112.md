 Domain Controller

> Explain the role of a Domain Controller.
   - The mechanism for configuration and implementation of group policies in an IT enterprise context.

> What is the benefit of being able to login with the same username and password on any computer joined to the domain? What are the security risks?
   - The benefit is that a user can have a single, strong password - even if less memorable - which improves security compared to several more memorable but less complex passwords (I think there's a human computation/memory aspect to that), and it also improves the user experience because it's much easier and more flexible to just log in wherever. The trade-off is that 1) if one password is compromised, it's compromised everywhere and 2) by extension, similarly to the flexibility for the authorized user, there's increased flexibility for the threat actor to gain access to any workstation with one set of credentials.

> Describe how group policies are used in domains?
   - Assuming this question is asking about the purpose of a domain (?), the group policies are used to control shared firewall and security settings, authorize a specified level of remote access (or not), to install or prevent installation of specific applications, and so on.
