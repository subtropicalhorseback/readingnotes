> How would you convince your future company to pursue SOC2 compliance?
   - In B2B sales and negotiations, confidence in a prospective partner is probably the most important factor in closing a deal. It can overcome cost discrepancies with less expensive (and less reliable) competitors/alternatives, and it can lead to other opportunities as 
   customer needs grow. Part of establishing trust as a technology company - particularly if working as a MSP or SaaS vendor - is demonstrable compliance with a reputable security framework such as SOC2.

> What are the five SOC2 Trust Principles?
   - Privacy, Security, Availability, Confidentiality, and Processing Integrity.

> How would your explain the three levels of the SOC2 pyramid in an analogy your friends or former colleagues would understand?
   - The SOC2 pyramid has a foundation of *Security Policies*, on which is built the 'execution' of *Security Procedures*, capped off with 'proof' or *Supporting Documentation*.
   - I [asked GPT](https://chat.openai.com/share/17320bc7-8eec-40d2-a95b-70468216a7ad) to help me write a metaphor: "Think of SOC 2 compliance like building a sturdy house. Policies are the blueprint, detailing what the house should look like and how it should function. Procedures are the step-by-step instructions for the builders, ensuring that each part of the house is constructed correctly. Proof is the collection of documents and records that show the house was built according to the blueprint and procedures. Just like a well-documented construction process ensures a strong and reliable house, SOC 2 compliance involves clear plans, careful execution, and evidence to demonstrate everything was done securely."
