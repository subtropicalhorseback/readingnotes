Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

> Name the three main components which make up PKI.
   - Certificate Authority, Registration Authority, Digital Certificates

> How would you explain, to a non-technical friend, the role PKI plays in protecting traffic between your browser and a web server.
   - PKIs are like a driver's license. The browser (and certificate authority) work like a bouncer, checking IDs at the door. Most of the time they catch the bad ones, but as the owner you still have the right to let that teenager in your bar - there are just risks associated with it.

> What is the main weakness of the PKI architecture?
   - Trust in the certificate authority that says a given key is valid, when the authority has a financial incentive to certify the keys.
