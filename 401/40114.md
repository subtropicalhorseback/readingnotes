Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)

[Resource](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2017/01/11/the-pros-cons-of-intrusion-detection-systems/)

> List 2 differences between firewalls and an IDS.
   - A firewall is a wall; an IDS is more like a security camera or a motion sensor. A firewall might prevent traffic, where an IDS just detects a pattern and sends a notification. Continuing the metaphor, an IDS is normally only looking at packets flowing across the connection (that is, can be described as directional - in the same way a camera normally faces outwards), where a firewall can block both incoming and outgoing traffic (because it's a wall).

> Under what circumstances would you choose a network-based IDS over a host-based IDS?
   - It pretty much comes down to scale and resources. Network based is much easier to install and requires less resource draw, but you have to have the infrastructure for network-based IDS to make sense.

> Name 3 major drawbacks of a NIDS.
   - Can miss unauthorized users, can't see internal network traffic (faces outwards), and can create false positives.
