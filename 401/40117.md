> Describe the differences between a VPC and a VPN to someone you know from your previous job.
   - A VPC is what's happening in the kitchen when you order from the drivethrough (website). You show up, make a request, and receive whatever you ordered (HTTP GET). You don't need to know there are seven stations, two are meat/sandwich, two are packer, two are fryer, and shift lead (servers, NAT router, etc.). You just need to interface with the outer layer.
   - A VPN is like having a secret tunnel from your house to the restaurant. Imagine you want to eat without your neighbor telling your wife about the prohibited cheeseburger. So, you use this special tunnel (VPN connection) that lets you enter and exit the restaurant without anyone noticing. Inside the tunnel, your identity is hidden, and your greasy paper bags are wrapped up, so no one knows what you're buying or where you're coming from (encryption). This way, you can freely visit your favorite restaurant (access resources), knowing that your trip is private and secure.
