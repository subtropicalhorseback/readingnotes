> How are Threat Hunting and Pentesting different?
   - Threat hunting is the active search inside a network for existing compromise, where pentesting is the active search for ways a network could become compromised in the future.

> What is the primary objective of Threat Hunting?
   - To determine whether previously undetected compromises exist, such as malware on a server reaching out to a C2 server outside the network - something that hasn't created a SIEM alert.

> Your organization has a fully functioning SOC but not active Threat Hunting. How would you advocate for your security organization to start Threat Hunting activities?
   - If the SOC is fully staffed and functioning, then there's virtually no cost to threat hunting because it involves the same concepts and staff, and can fill idle time between alert investigations. It detects the 49 times out of 50 that a SIEM missed the trigger.
