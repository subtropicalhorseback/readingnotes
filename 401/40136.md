> Explain how a cross-site scripting attack works in non-technical terms.
   - It's just browser based remote code execution - it's like typing code on the infected user's keyboard and interacting with a web application as that user.

> What are the three types of XSS attacks?
   - Reflected, stored, and DOM-based; the difference is just the location of the script and vulnerability.

> If an attacker successfully exploits a XSS vulnerability, what malicious actions would they be able to perform?
   - redirection, keylogging, session hijacking, and anything the compromised user(s) can do in the application

> What are some security controls that can be implemented to prevent XSS attacks?
   - filtering input, encoding output data, using appropriate response headers, and the content security policy
