Data file encryption

> You have been made responsible for the companyâ€™s file server. How would you preserve the three elements of the CIA triad?
   - So many ways, but in relation to this assignment, I would enforce basic encryption of the data at rest (hard drive encryption) and data in motion (secure connections only) to limit CIA risk at the central 'watering hole' so to speak - which is the prime target for notional evil-doers.

> Explain how hashing verifies data integrity using non-technical terms.
   - It's like the bathroom cleaning log at your local Denny's. It's updated every time there's a change. If it hasn't been updated, there hasn't been a change.

> How is hashing and encryption different?
   - Hashing is unidirectional and normally in parallel to the data; encryption can be undone and normally overwrites the data to protect it.
