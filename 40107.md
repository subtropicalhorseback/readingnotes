Protecting Data at Rest with Device Encryption

[Resource](https://www.digitalguardian.com/blog/data-protection-data-in-transit-vs-data-at-rest)

> From your day to day computer use, provide examples of when data is at rest and when it is in transit.
   - When I take a picture on my phone, it's at rest on my phone (no cloud storage). When I text it to my wife, it's in transit. When her phone downloads it, it is at rest again on the other end.

> Explain the role data encryption with regards to the CIA triad.
   - Encryption preserves confidentiality, theoretically, and also is suggestive of integrity (because a changed key or modified encrypted data is likely to create other errors). It slightly reduces availability in some cases due to processing times.
