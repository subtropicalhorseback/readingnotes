> How would a security team benefit from implementing a SOAR solution?
   - SOAR stands for security automation and orchestration. Essentially, they function like "If This Then That" (IFTTT) logic to drive security tools in response to perceived threats. Implementation of SOAR can improve security response efficiency, accuracy, and timeliness by removing the human factor from the equation. As second order effects, employee burnout is probably reduced. My personal view is that the model is only good as the training material, though, so I'm not sure that 100% replacement is the solution so much as augmentation of a human team with a SOAR tool.

> Explain how a SOAR solution fits into the Incident Response process.
   - SOAR speeds up and improves Incident Response by responding automatically at all hours of the day (no 30 minute recall) and incorporating all available/appropriate security tools, like firewalls. Additionally, SOAR helps pre-empt some incidents by completing routing settings checks when new threat intelligence is added to the model.
