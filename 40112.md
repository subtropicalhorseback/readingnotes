> What are three tasks which SOCs often perform?
   - Pinpoint and defeat network threats
   - Assess vulnerabilities and penetrations
   - Monitor and gather threat intelligence

> Explain what a SIEM solution is and how the SOC utilizes it in non-technical terms.
   - A SIEM is like your own little cyber FBI. You tell it what to watch for (threat definitions), then it goes out and collects information, puts it together (aggregation), conducts some kind of analysis that must be reviewed later by humans, can take action in response to alerts and in some cases remediates vulnerabilities, and provides reports about what it has been doing.

> How does the typical SOC team structure resemble the structure of an IT Help Desk.?
   - In the same way that a help desk or service desk has a tiered response ranging from level 1 triage to higher level investigations and C-suite recommendations, so, too, does a SOC operate in a pyramidic hierarchy, escalating needs for assistance based on complexity or severity of a given issue.
