> What are the benefits of a forward proxy?
   - All of the answers for and against proxy servers boil down to access control. Use of a forward proxy can obfuscate the true client sending web requests and conversely can 'mask' the web server from which the client is requesting data (via the proxy).

> Explain the differences between a forward and a reverse proxy?
   - Practically, they're the same thing; organizationally, they're on different sides of the internet from each other. A forward proxy exists for client requests going out (client side), while a reverse proxy exists for client requests coming in (server side).

> Explain to your manager why your organization might benefit from implementing a reverse proxy?
   - Use of a proxy creates a layer of separation between the internet and the servers. As such, a potential attacker (or inadvertent Denial of Service process) won't know the IP address of individual servers, and the proxy can also assist in caching and load balancing, which improves performance of content delivery.
