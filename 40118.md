> Explain CloudWatch Events to a non-technical friend.
   - CloudWatch events is the technical equivalent of staring through the window as a passenger in a car - taking in everything that's happening, noting anything significant. If a particular observation is noteworthy (meets rule/trigger criteria) then an action is taken - for example, if you see a cow, you say "Look at those cows!"

> What do CloudWatch Logs helps us achieve?
   - It gives us 'history' of the events that have occurred - like a text version of playing back the dashcam video from the first question - by saving logs.

> What capabilities does CloudWatch Anomaly detection have?
   - If something occurs that is inconsistent with expectations based on historical events, then there is an anomaly. With the right configuration, this triggers an alarm.
