[Resource](https://www.technipages.com/what-is-burp-suite)

> Explain how Burp Suite allows us to analyze web application traffic.
   - The proxy itself allows you to configure which domains have their web traffic intercepted and what sort of traffic is shown. For example, intercepting web requests is helpful as you can edit them to test how the website reacts to unusual requests, however intercepting the responses as there’s no real point in editing them.

> What does the Repeater tool allow us to do with requests?
   - Repeater allows you to import a web request and then make manual modifications to it and see the response side by side allowing you to make minor adjustments to attempted exploits and easily see if it’s working.

> Why might this be a useful tool for an attacker?
   - It facilitates fine-tuning of malicious payloads to bypass security measures or exploit vulnerabilities within a web application, enabling a more targeted and effective attack strategy.
