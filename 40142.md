Pass the Hash with Mimikatz

[Resource](https://www.varonis.com/blog/what-is-mimikatz)

> Name the six credential-gathering techniques which Mimikatz is able to perform and explain how two of them work.
   - Pass the hash: Windows used to store password data in an NTLM hash. Attackers use Mimikatz to pass that exact hash string to the target computer to log in. Attackers don’t even need to crack the password — they just need to use the hash string as-is. It’s the equivalent of finding the master key to a building on the lobby floor. You need just that one key to get into all the doors.
   - overpass the hash
   - pass the ticket
   - kerberoast golden tickets: This is a pass-the-ticket attack, but it’s a specific ticket for a hidden account called KRBTGT, which is the account that encrypts all of the other tickets. A golden ticket provides you with non-expiring domain admin credentials to any computer on the network.
   - kerberoast silver tickets
   - pass the cache

> What are four ways we can defend against Mimikatz attacks. Explain how two of the mitigations can stop Mimikatz.
   - Restrict admin privileges. This can be done by limiting admin privileges to only users who need them.

   - Disable password-caching. Windows caches password hashes that were recently used through their system registry. Mimikatz can then gain access to these cached passwords, which is why it’s important to change your default settings to cache zero recent passwords. This can be accessed through Windows Settings > Local Policy > Security Options > Interactive Logon.  

   - Turn off debug privileges. Windows’ default settings allows local admins to debug the system, which Mimikatz can exploit. Turning off debugging privileges on machines is a best practice to safeguard your system.  

   - Configure additional local security authority (LSA) protection. Upgrading to Windows 10 can help mitigate the types of authentication attacks that Mimikatz enables. However, when this isn’t possible, Microsoft has additional LSA configuration items that help reduce the attack surface area.
