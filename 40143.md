> Explain a Sniffing attack using non-technical terms.
   - It's taking the mail out of your neighbor's mailbox, reading the letters, and putting them back in the box before your neighbor missed them.

> What are the two types of sniffing attacks and what are some pros and cons of each approach?

   - Passive sniffing:  The attacker secretly monitors network traffic, usually on a shared network segment or broadcast domain.
      -  Pros: Difficult to detect as it doesn't actively transmit data.
      -  Cons: Limited to traffic observable on the same network segment.

   - Active sniffing: The attacker injects crafted packets into the network to trigger responses or to manipulate traffic flows.
      -  Pros: Can gather information from broader parts of the network, even switched ones. .
      -  Cons: More detectable due to the injection of crafted packets into the network flow.

> How does encryption protect traffic against sniffing attacks?

   - Encryption scrambles the contents of data packets with complex mathematical algorithms. Even if an attacker sniffs the encrypted traffic, they can't decipher it without the corresponding decryption key.
