## What is Bash?

### What is the primary function of a shell in a computerâ€™s operating system?
   - An interface wrapped around the OS kernel through which the user can issue commands to applications on how and when they should complete various tasks.

### How does Bash locate and execute commands on a Linux or Unix system?
   - They're located in a system directory.
     
### How can you determine if your system is running a Bash shell?
   - You can try echo $0

### What makes Bash scripting powerful and why is it considered scriptable?
   - That it is scriptable is what makes it powerful. It is scriptable because the commands can be placed into a text file and then run through Bash.

### Bash scripting allows for customization, automation, and efficiency. Discuss methods or practices from your previous work experience or cultural background that aim to achieve similar goals in daily tasks.
   - The closest equivalent is that in my desk job we had some excel macros and some moderate-code GUI type automation.
