# OPS 102 Reading Notes

##  Day 1 (9 Oct 23)

### Intro

Here's a top-level bulleted list of what we've talked about:
- Balance of personal vs ops computers
- Tools/websites
- Growth Mindset
- Learning in the 'pit'
- Overall structure of the course
- New github repo
   - cite chatgpt by sharing conversations https://chat.openai.com/share/f5a73920-5f5c-41ac-95f3-c50d2a538a3e
   - cite github references by sharing links https://github.com/RogerHuba/ops-reading-notes/blob/main/reading1.md
- Existence of VSC and use for side-by-side .md editing/preview

#### What is a computer?

- Machine takes input, does process, gives output
- Only as smart as the instructions (ie, user)
- layers of computing/abstraction
- hardware: 
   - the big hack, china, chips
   - hardware serves up software, but at the base level it is a physical thing
   - hardware manufacturer doesn't need to know the code // coder doesn't need to know the hardware details // how to use database vs how to construct etc - like lanes (stay in your own)
   - looking down from airplane like height determines detail but there's a trade off for complexity (city view vs neighborhood vs street vs house vs room)
   - don't need to know everything about everything - that's the point

##### key components
software - OS (controls hardware and passes control to some hardware like volume, gpu, etc via user interfaces)

hardware - tangible components

##### stages of computing
1) Input
   - action by hardware input (keyboard, click, etc)

2) Processing
   - OS determines response procedure to hardware input; tells hardware how to process
   - might have OS vs Application conflict but normally resolved at OS level

3) Output
   - compute presents the result of the task to the user

##### circuits and logic
circuits are building blocks for logic and processing - all boils down to binary interpretation of electric signals. circuit values change based on input

###### BITS AND BYTES

smallest unit of data (IO) is a bit - ref to binary. electricity on or off

next level up is a byte - 8 bits of memory 00000000

10110110 is 182


##### computer parts

motherboard
   - ram
      - generally, power down deletes mem from ram
   - onboard graphics
   - transistors
   - resistors
   - processors (cpu)
      - determines max processing speed
   - some peripheral card connections // PCI/PCIe
   - power interface
   - SATA data connectors for SSD/HDD/CD
   - fan controllers
