# Reading 3

## Here are my notes for Reading 3

- What is the BIOS?
     - The BIOS is the basic input/output system that helps get the computer started and loads the OS into RAM.
       
- Use analogies from your previous background to explain what happens during the booting process?
     - The BIOS is like the lowly page. Pushing the power button wakes the page up. He scurries around checking the time (via CMOS) and locating the knight (OS - on HD), then ensuring everything is in working order (where is that shield/keyboard!?) before rousing the knight (OS - on HD), getting the knight on his horse (loaded onto RAM), and fading into the background like the support character he is.
       
- What is the “Power On Self Test”?
     - The POST is when the BIOS does a series of system checks to make sure everything is functioning correctly.
       
- What is the CMOS?
     - The CMOS is volatile storage of basic settings like date and time that helps the BIOS get oriented before initiation of OS bootup.
       
- What is the CMOS battery?
     - The CMOS battery provides constant power for the volatile CMOS memory; without the battery, the motherboard cannot sustain the CMOS data.
