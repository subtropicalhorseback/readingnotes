# Reading 5

## Here are my notes for Reading 5


- Explain the terms “shell”, “terminal”, “cli”, and “command prompt”. Why are these still used today, when we have graphical interfaces?
   - All of these words are a way to communicate (without a mouse) at a low level with the computer, kind of like talking to a dog or a young child
  
- What are the commands to change directories, list the file’s contents and rename/move files?
   - cd changes directories
   - ls lists contents of the current directory (pwd)
   - mv moves files
  
- What are relative and absolute paths? What is special about starting with a ~ (tilde) or a ‘/’ character in the path?
   - a relative path is in comparison to the user's current directory; an absolute path is like c://documents: a coordinate in the OS
   - the tilde and slash are used for absolute paths
  
- Explain what Linux is, using anything except English.
   - د کمپیوټر کارولو او د هرڅه کار کولو څرنګوالي بدلولو لپاره د عملیاتو مختلف سیسټم
